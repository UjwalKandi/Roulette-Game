# Roulette-Game
This program simulates a game of roulette. In roulette, a wheel spins and yields a number between 1 and 49 when a ball drops into a numbered slot. The initial amount is monitored throughout the game and will be reminded to the player after each guess. If the amount goes zero, then the game ends.
